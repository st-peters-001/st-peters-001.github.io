We set up our environment in a way that evokes a home like feel. Providing our children with 
consistent and natural spaces, the children have the freedom to move and change the environment 
around. Our environment is presented to the children with key learning centres that are consistent 
yet are extended and built upon depending on the interests of the children. During free play time the 
learning centres are open for the children to choose what they would like to play with. Within each 
learning centre the props and tools may vary from time to time. In all our learning centres we teach 
children to respect the materials, tools and the space by encouraging them to clean up the area 
before they move on to play somewhere else.

 In our outdoor space we have rainwater tanks, a worm farm, compost bin, herb and vegetable 
garden, Indigenous garden, a wide variety of trees, plants, sandpit, water, mud, rocks and a frog 
pond. As the children explore the natural environment, play in the sandpit and mud kitchen, help 
out with the gardening they are engaging in open-ended interactions, risk-taking, exploration, 
discovery and connection with nature. All the while fostering an appreciation of the natural 
environment and developing an environmental awareness.

natural world and shares the responsibility for caring for it”* – Richard Louv.
