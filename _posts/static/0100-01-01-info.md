We are licensed for 3 - 5 year olds and cater for 27 children a day. Children generally attend for 2 or 3 days per week. Our Staff to child ratios are excellent and above regulations. We are proudly community based and managed by a parent management committee.

We are open Monday – Friday from 9am - 3pm and close during school holidays. Families are welcome and encouraged to stay and play with their children during the morning period.

Please feel free to come and visit the preschool during our opening times. Wednesday’s are a preferred day to visit, but families are welcome at any time to visit the preschool.
