At our preschool the program is based on play as a method for children to learn, explore their world 
and engage in rich, meaningful interactions with each other and the environment. We believe that 
children’s play is the most effective and appropriate vehicle for children’s learning and so we provide 
children with large chunks of time to engage in child initiated play experiences. Our planning is 
influenced by the belief that relationships play an integral role in how children learn. We believe 
strongly that children learn through responsive and authentic relationships with their peers and other 
adults, our staff play a vital role in this aspect of children’s learning based on respectful interactions 
with them, their families and other colleagues.

*Play energizes us and enlivens us. It eases our burdens. It renews our natural sense of optimism and 
opens us up to new possibilities.* – Stuart Brown, MD
