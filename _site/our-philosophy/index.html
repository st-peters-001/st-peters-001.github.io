    <h1>Our Philosophy</h1>
  </div>
  <div class='prose'>
    <p>We acknowledge the Cadigal people, the traditional owners of the land on which our preschool
stands and where we grow and learn.</p>

<p><img src="/img/philosophy.jpg" alt="Our philosophy" /></p>

<p>We believe that early childhood is a significant stage of life during which each child has the right to
be treated with respect and dignity. We believe that the family is the most significant influence in a
child’s life. We strive to work in authentic relationship with families and the wider community in
order to ensure the well-being of the whole child and the best outcomes for all children. We value
each child’s unique experience and strive to be inclusive. Our work with children and families is
motivated by our desire for social justice, and by the values of respect, compassion and
understanding. We believe that children should be given the freedom and support to explore their
world through play, learn about relationships, express their creativity, and develop positive attitudes
to learning in a safe, loving, and stimulating environment.</p>

<p>• Our philosophy and program is informed by:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child</p></li>
<li><p>The Early Childhood Australia Code of Ethics</p></li>
<li><p>The National Quality Framework</p></li>
<li><p>Ongoing professional training and development, and current research in the field.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>• The philosophy is dynamic and will be reviewed regularly.</p>

<p>• We ensure that Indigenous perspectives are incorporated into the program.</p>

<p>• Staff are valued as professionals and integral to the success of the preschool and its’ goals.</p>

<p>• We are aware of our role in the local community and reflect this context in our program. We value
the contribution of the parent community as our management body.</p>

<p>• We strive for equity of access to preschool for all children and families.</p>

<p>• We take a holistic approach to our practice – considering the whole child; personal, social, spiritual,
emotional, physical and cognitive.</p>

<p>• We strive to operate in an environmentally sustainable way and to share this respect for our
natural environment with the children through our program.</p>
