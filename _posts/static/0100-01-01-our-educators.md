We value ongoing professional development and staff regularly attend training to ensure that our program is based on current, progressive thinking and  research.

Vanna Lockwood (BEd Early Childhood) is the Educational Leader of the team, and has 25 years experience in early education. Vanna also teaches at The Institute of Early Childhood at Macquarie University and is currently involved in research with a focus on literacy learning prior to school.






**A recent reflection by Vanna ...**

At St Peters Community Preschool our focus is on building authentic relationships with families and children. Growing a strong community comes from creating a sense of belonging based on understanding, respect and compassion for each other. The teachers at St Peters engage in reflective practice where we take time to consider and analyse the important role we have in the lives of children. Our practice is influenced by these reflections which help us to recognise and celebrate the dynamic nature of our role as teachers. 

 “Seasons and Change” is my refleciton on the inevitability of change ...
 
__This week the children and I have been talking about the change of season as we notice the weather getting warmer, the jasmine blooming and feeling Spring in the air. It has prompted me to reflect on how everything is always changing in big and small ways, and preschool children in particular are changing rapidly as they grow and learn. Our role as educators and carers of these precious children is to be aware of how these changes affect each individual child as well as the preschool group. We need to respond to these changes by adapting our curriculum - what we do every day.

 As the year moves on the children are feeling comfortable, have well established friendships and feel that they belong at St Peters. I am noticing that more of my time is spent challenging children’s thinking, following up on their interests, having lovely long conversations and also just sitting back and watching as children get down to the very important business of play. There is a cohesiveness to the groups of children that has grown from the hard work that the teachers, children and their families have put in to making everyone feel that this is their place to grow and learn.
The idea of there being a time for everything is comforting to me and each year without fail I watch as children change along with the seasons – it’s nice to see that this year is no different. Other than constantly having to remind children to put their hats on it’s lovely to know that Summer is on the way!_
