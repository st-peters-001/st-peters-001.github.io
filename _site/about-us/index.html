    <h1>About Us</h1>

  <div class='prose'>
    <p>St Peters Community Preschool is a special place in the Inner West of Sydney where children, families, educators and the wider community play, learn and grow together.
We integrate the Early Years Learning Framework into our practice, focusing on the aspects of Belonging, Being and Becoming.
<strong>Belonging</strong> is the basis for living a fulfilling life. Children feel they belong because of the relationships they have with their family, community, culture and place.
<strong>Being</strong> is about living here and now. Childhood is a special time in life and children need time to just ‘be’—time to play, try new things and have fun.
<strong>Becoming</strong> is about the learning and development that young children experience. Children start to form their sense of identity from an early age, which shapes the type of adult they will become.
