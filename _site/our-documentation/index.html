<p>Our daily reflections will focus mainly on how small groups of children are engaged throughout the day. We believe that relationships are the most important part of our curriculum. We hope that our daily reflections will encourage us to explore how the relationships that exist at preschool influence all aspects of our day, and importantly how they impact on children’s learning. It is however important to recognise that each child exists as an individual as well as a member of the larger group. The daily photographs and portfolios help us to consider this and explore it more thoroughly.</p>

<p>We believe that family is the most significant influence on a child and therefore we encourage you to share with us relevant interests and events that we can reflect in our program and planning.</p>

<p>Each child has their own portfolio that is a personal record of their time at St Peters Preschool. Included in the portfolio are photographs, written reflections and samples of your child’s work. The information in the portfolios is also used to influence planning, with staff spending time reflecting on how your child is growing in all areas and how best to support and nurture this development. At the end of each year we write a summary of the child’s year at preschool. We find that families and children find these portfolios are a special record of this time in their lives and are treasured long after they leave preschool.</p>
