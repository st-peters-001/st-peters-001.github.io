    <h1>Our Program</h1>

  <div class='prose'>
    <p>At our preschool the program is based on play as a method for children to learn, explore their world
and engage in rich, meaningful interactions with each other and the environment. We believe that
children’s play is the most effective and appropriate vehicle for children’s learning and so we provide
children with large chunks of time to engage in child initiated play experiences. Our planning is
influenced by the belief that relationships play an integral role in how children learn. We believe
strongly that children learn through responsive and authentic relationships with their peers and other
adults, our staff play a vital role in this aspect of children’s learning based on respectful interactions
with them, their families and other colleagues.</p>

<p>Weaving the principles of the Early Years Learning Framework and National Quality Framework into
our program, keeping up with current research and theory. Ensuring our program is planned in a
dynamic way and happens organically.</p>

<p><em>Play energizes us and enlivens us. It eases our burdens. It renews our natural sense of optimism and
opens us up to new possibilities.</em> – Stuart Brown, MD</p>
