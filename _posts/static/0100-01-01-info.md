##Family in-put

We value our families and the relationships we have built with them. Below are some statements from our families about their own personal experiences of St Peters Community Preschool.

St Peters Preschool has been the best decision we have made for Ciara. From the moment we stepped foot into the Preschool we have felt the love, warmth and welcoming atmosphere of the school and the teachers. The teachers are completely passionate about their jobs and the children. Ciara loves her time there and is always full of chat about all the wonderful activities she has achieved each day. We love reading the daily journal and watching the photo slide show as well. We love the school and wouldn’t change a thing!!!!! – Paul and Lisa.
